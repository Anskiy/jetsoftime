--ABOUT--

Jets of Time is a remake of Wings of Time, intended to create faster seeds while taking more liberties with the gameplay. The progression has been altered greatly, and seeds can usually be beat within the 2:30:00 mark. The gameplay is *still* mostly classic Chrono Trigger, so being good at the base game helps a lot.

--USAGE--

Windows users can directly run the provided .exe, Mac and Linux users should run randomizer.py with Python 3.0 or above in the sourcefiles folder. Either enter the location of the ROM or drag and drop it into the window. Follow the onscreen instructions afterwards.
